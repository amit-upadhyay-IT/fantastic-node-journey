# MongoDB on cloud

There is a server called as mongolab (mlab.com), this is database as a service (i.e. MongoDB as a service). This is a cloud based service of MongoDB and they have a free tier available.

Create a database from the console on your dashboard.
First thing you need to work with a database which you create on a cloud platform is that you need to have a user, with which you can start interacting with your application.

When you have a MongoDB running on local machine you can use a mongo shell to interact with it. What if, your MongoDB is running on the cloud? How do you interact with that?

The beauty of this service is that, they provide an address using which we can connect to our cloud db using shell.
