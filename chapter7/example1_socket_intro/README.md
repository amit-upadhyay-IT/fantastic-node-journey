Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

With Socket.IO there is no need of managing anything manually, doing any structures, processing, setting up socket client things on your server. All you do is that use the module `socket.io`.

The thing with Socket.IO is that the data structure it is bound to is loosely coupled (it is really not bound to a data structure at all). It can transmit JSON data but it can be in anyway (nested or not-nested). The other solution that is parallel to socket.io is firebase. In Firebase API they provide information in structured format in their encrypted proprietary way. So for those scenarios where we don't want to structure the data we prefer using Socket.IO
