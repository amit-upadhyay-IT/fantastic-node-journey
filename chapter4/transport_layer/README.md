## The Transport Layer
Transport layer is responsible for maintaining flow of control. The transport layer takes the data from each application, and integrates it all into a single stream.
This layer is also responsible for providing error checking and performing data recovery when necessary. In essence, the Transport layer is responsible for ensuring that all of the data makes it from sending host to receiving host.

It deals with data transport issues between systems. It offers reliability, establishes virtual circuits, detects/recovers from errors, and provides flow control.

## How OSI model works?
The OSI reference model is actually used to describe how data that is generated by a user, such as email message, moves through a number of intermediary forms until it is converted into a stream of data that can actually be placed on the network media and sent out over the network.
The model also describes how a communication session is established between two devices, such as two computers, on the network.

Since other types of devices, such as printers and routers, can be involved in network communication, devices(including computers) on the network are actually referred to as nodes. Therefore, a client computer on the network or a server on the network would each be referred to as a node.

While sending data over a network, it moves down through the OSI stack and is transmitted over the transmission media. When the data is received by a node, such as another computer on the network, it moves up through the OSI stack until it is again in a form that can be accessed by a user on that computer.

Each of the layers in the OSI model is responsible for certain aspect of getting user data in to a format that can be transmitted on the network. Some layers are for establishing and maintaining the connection between the communicating nodes, and other layers are responsible for the addressing of the data so that it can be determined where the data originated (on which node) and where the data's destination is.

An important aspect of the OSI model is that each layer in the stack provides services to the layer directly above it. Only the Application Layer, which is at the top of the stack, would not provide services to a higher-level layer.

The process of moving user data down to OSI stack on a sending node (again, such as a computer) is called encapsulation. The process of moving raw data received by node a node up the OSI stack is referred to as de-encapsulation.
