A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.

- > Duplex: can be used for both read and write operation.
- > Transform: A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input


All Streams are instances of EventEmitter, but also have other methods and properties depending on whether they are Readable, Writable, Duplex or Transform. This means: Streams emit "events" and "data" along with some of those events. Some of the commonly used events are:
