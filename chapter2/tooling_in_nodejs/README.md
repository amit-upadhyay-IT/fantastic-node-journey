## Tooling in nodejs

For nodejs we don't have an official IDE which creates the projects and file for you. Since you see the versatility of nodejs. So they have come up with a module "YEOMAN". It is "THE WEB'S SCAFFOLDING TOOL FOR MODERN WEBAPPS". Yo is the scaffolding tool engine which leverages 'bower' and 'grunt' to build the whole process. We can use the Yeoman generater for creating a node module. Yeoman setup is one time installation. For running Yeoman we would require three modules.

Use this command to install yeoman:

	npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli

Since it has -g flag, so it can be run from anywhere in the terminal. Remember for 'bower' to work you should have git installed on your machine. To know more about bower, visit [here](http://npmjs.com/package/bower). Bower and npmjs are both package managers. Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management. We can also search for bower packages (like we do for npm). The difference between npm and bower is that npm hierarchical dependency manager.
